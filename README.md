# AutoGuardian: Predictive Alerts for Vehicle Care

## The Idea
AutoGuardian is a solution to enhance the customer's vehicle ownership experience by predicting vehicle maintenance beforehand and notifying the same to the customer. Our system leverages real-time vehicle data such as Battery Capacity, Oil Life, Fuel Tank Levels, Tyre Pressure, etc. which is passed on to an ML model trained on historical vehicle data to forecast potential vehicle issues. It then sends notifications to the vehicle owner to schedule maintenance appointments.

This solution can be used as an **API** that can be integrated into existing smart car systems.
